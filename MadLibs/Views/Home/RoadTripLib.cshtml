    <h1>Road Trip Mad Lib!</h1>
    <p>It's time for a Road trip and i'm so @Model.EmotionOne! My Family</p> <p>and I are going to have a(n) @Model.AdjectiveOne time. First, we're</p>
    <p>going to a @Model.PlaceOne to see @Model.ThingOne. Then we're going</p>
    <p>to a Museum and I'm going to get a souvenir a @Model.ThingTwo.</p>
    <p>After that, we're going to go on my favorite beach located in</p>
    <p>@Model.PlaceTwo. Next we are going to go eat @Model.FoodOne.</p>
    <p>Then, we are going to take a picture with a @Model.ThingThree!</p>
    <p>Then we will go to the Amusement Park and go on my favorite</p>
    <p>Roller Coaster the @Model.ThingFour and grab a snack of</p>
    <p>@Model.TreatOne before going to the hotel and swimming in the</p>
    <p>@Model.PlaceThree. That's always my favorite part of a Road Trip.</p>
    <p>We are so very @Model.AdjectiveTwo to go on our Road Trip this year!</p>
